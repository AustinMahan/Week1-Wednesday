//Array for Days !!

// For any methods that we didn't cover, please refer to the Array Documentation.
// Discovering new things is fun and a great way to learn!!
// Use console.log to check your results.
// Write the current state of your array to index.html after each question. Use any elements you like!
// ==========================================================================

// 1. Declare a variable whose value is an empty Array. Use any method you choose to add at least 4 items to it.

// 2. Add an additional item to the beginning of your Array.

// 3. Remove the second and third items.

// 4. Add two new items after the second item.

// 5. Write 'The current length of the array is....' using the .length method

// Use the following Array for questions 6-10:
var things = ['mug', 'book', 'mouse', 'plant', 'sunglasses'];

// 6. Change 'mouse' to 'keyboard'

// 7. Declare a variable called lastItem whose using .pop() Add two new items to lastItem, on at the beginning and one at the end.

// 8. Create a new Array called itemLast. The items should be the same as lastItem, only in reverse order.

// 9. Remove the first item of itemLast.

// 10. Remove all items from itemLast (No need to write to the document. Just console.log to test your results)

// Use the following array for questions 11-14:
var people = ['Bill', 'Ted', 'Emily', 'Andrea', 'Doug'];

// 11. Arrange the items alphabetically. Store this Array as orderedPeople

// 12. Add two new people after 'Doug'

// 13. Remove everybody except 'Andrea' and 'Ted'

// 14. Add a new person to the beginning of the Array

// 15. Using the Arrays below, create a single Array called numberPets whose value is [12, 5, 9, 27, 'fish', 'dog']
var firstArray = [12, 5, 9, 27];
var secondArray = ['fish', 'dog'];

// BONUS: Transform array1 into array2 using as few lines of code as you can without directly changing the value of an item (ie array1[0] = item)

var array1 = [2, 'dog', 34, 'Bill', 'plant', 'mug', 17];



//Goal
var array2 = ['plant', 17, 2, 'Bill', 'dog'];
